THIS IS OLD SCHOOL WORK.

Requirements:
Python 2.6
wx-widgets
visual-graph


A projectile physics simulation project. Takes inputs for wind, angle thrown, 
coefficient of restitution and other properties to simulate the trajectory 
of a ball thrown with those properties.
The application includes the ability to scrub through the timeline of the simulation
to pinpoint certain times across the flight path.
